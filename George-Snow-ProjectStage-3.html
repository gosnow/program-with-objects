  </div>
    <div class="concept-description">
      <p>HTML and CSS are "languages" (both with syntax and rules)<br>
      HTML controls the "structure" of a web page, while CSS controls the "style" of a page (how it looks).<br>
      When programmers talk about the "DOM" (Document Object Model)<br>
      they are talking about the tree-like structure of a page.<br>
      An HTML tag is an element in the (DOM) tree.<br>

       <div class="concept-description">
        <p>Everything on an HTML page is a box or inside a box.<br>
        To "Boxify" a design is to break up the contents of a page into boxes.  CSS controls the look and shape of the boxes.
        </p>

        <p>HTML is made up of:<br>
          - text content - <b>what (bold)</b> <em>you see 
          (italics for emphasis)</em>
        </p>

        <p> - markup - what it looks like (this is in a paragraph)</p>
         - (br for break to next line)<br>
         - references to other documents - e.g., images and videos<br>
         - links to other pages: This website is <a href="www.udacity.com">my favorite</a>

      <h2>CSS - Cascading Style Sheets</h2>

       <div class="concept-title">        
       <h3>Definition</h3>
      </div>
       </div>
        <div class="concept-description">   
          <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets which gives programmers a way to control the style of related HTML elements. This is done by giving similar HTML elements the same classname and then specifying the style that should apply to that class.
          </p>
           <p>Add to the top of the HTML file the following element:<br>
            (Left bracket): link rel="stylesheet" href="(name of file).css" (right bracket).  This connects the CSS file to this HTML file.

        <div class="concept-title">     
        <h3>Search and Replace</h3>
      </div>
        </div>
         <div class="concept-description">           
         <p>You can also think about CSS as a search and replace tool: you identify a class or a tag of the element you want to find (or match, in CSS terminology), and then what you want to do with it, or what property values to replace with different ones.
         </p>
         </div>
      <div class="concept">
        <div class="concept-title">        
        <h3>Order Matters</h3>
      </div>
        </div>
         <div class="concept-description">
          <p>It also matters where you define the rules and in what order they are applied. Styles can be defined in different places and are applied in the following order, with definitions further down the list overwriting previous definitions:
            • the default style of a browser (different browsers have slightly different styles)
            • stylesheet in a separate file (this is what you will be mostly using)
            • stylesheet inside HTML (this can be done for small projects but is not ideal)
            • inline style in an element (this can also be done but should be avoided)
          </p>
         </div>


      <div class="concept">
        <div class="concept-title">        
        <h3>Specifics Matter</h3>
      </div>
        </div>
         <div class="concept-description">        
          <p>"Cascading" means that rules are applied not only to the elements they directly match, but also to all of those elements' child elements. However, if a child element has multiple, overlapping rules defined for it, the more specific rule takes effect.<br>
          In CSS, house rules are the same as national laws; but first you cascade down to the most specific rule that best describes the element, and that rule is applied.<br>
          In CSS you select an element that you want to apply some style to; like p for paragraph; and all paragraphs will also have this style.
          You can also select a class that was previously defined, and apply some style by using attribute: value; such as:<br>
            .description {<br>
              color: red;<br>
            }<br>
          You can also combine selectors; for example you can select all links that are inside an element, with the class: article.<br>

        <div class="concept-title">
        <h3>The Box Model</h3>
      </div>
        </div>
         <div class="concept-description">
          <p>The center of the box is where the Content goes; such as Text, or an image.<br>
          The Padding is affected by the background color.<br>
          The Border is inherited from the color property of the box.<br>
          The Margin is the space between boxes, and is transparent with no properties.
          </p>
          
          <p>So that it is easier to make layouts of boxes for the webpage, use CSS style:<br>
          *{<br>
            -webkit-box-sizing; border-box;<br>
            -moz-box-sizing; border-box;<br>
            -ms-box-sizing; border-box;<br>
            box-sizing; border-box;<br>
          }<br>
          This includes border and padding and center for calculating the real size of a box.<br>
          You can then tweek the size of the border and padding, but the size of the overall box will remain the same (it does not include margin).<br>
          To display properly in older browsers, add Browser specific prefixes.<br>
          Box size can be set by pixel or percentage.<br>
          Also you can set max width, so if the box is set for percentage of the size of the screen, and the screen is shrunk by the user, the box will shrink or grow, up to the max width but not larger.
          </p>

         <p>Flexbox
         </p>
          <p>A great guide to flexbox can be found <a href="http://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/">here</a>!<br>
          At around 1:02, Jessica adds the CSS rule display: flex to element.style, which adds the CSS directly to the div element on the left-hand side of the development tools. In future videos, this CSS rule will be in the main CSS file, style.css:<br>
          .app {<br>
              display: flex;<br>
          }<br>
          This rule as-is works with Chrome 29+, IE 11+, and Mozilla 28+. <br>
          In order to support Safari, the -webkit- prefix must be added:<br>
          .app {<br>
              display: -webkit-flex;<br>
              display: flex;<br>
          }<br>
          </p>

          <p>Box Sizing
          </p>
          </p>There are four main points that Jessica addressed about box sizing.<br>
            1. HTML elements are boxes and each box has 4 components.<br>
            2. Because there are so many components to each box, it can often be hard to get the size of a box just right.<br>
            3. There are two techniques you can use to help deal with sizing issues.<br>
            <!--Not sure how to indent these next two items. -->
              a. Set sizes in terms of percents rather than pixels.<br>
              b. Set the box-sizing attribute to border-box for every element. <br>
            4. Different browsers work slightly differently. Sometimes this causes different browsers to display the same code differently.<br>
          </p>
          </p>Box Positioning<br>
            1. Divs are block elements (as opposed to inline), so by default they take up the entire width of a page.<br>
            2. Adding the rule display: flex; to the appropriate CSS will override this behavior and let divs appear next to each other.<br>
            <br>
            To get the extra white space between the image and the text, see Dev tools for margin for image box, save to css file.
          </p><br>

          <p>Example of style properties from course exercise:<br>
            h1 {<br>
              font-size: x-large;<br>
              background-color: #33BEBE;<br>
              color: white; <br>
            }<br>
            .screenshot {<br>
              max-width: 460px;<br>
            }<br>
            .description {<br>
              max-width: 705px;<br>
              margin-left: 15px<br>
            }<br>
            <br>
            The correct header background color is #33bebe<br>
            As for the image margin - you could do it in many different ways, since the problem really is the whitespace between 2 boxes - image and the description.<br>
            You could for example change the right margin of the image to push the text away. Or, leave the image margin at 0 and instead apply a style to the left margin of the text instead.<br>

        <h3>Thinking about "cascading"</h3>
      </div>
        </div>
         <div class="concept-description">      
          <p>Cascading is about inheritance, and understanding it requires abstract thinking.</p>
          The following article is from Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#Inheritance">Inheritance</a>
          
          <p>Inheritance            
          Inheritance is a key feature in CSS, it relies on the ancestor-descendant relationship to operate. Inheritance is the mechanism by which properties are applied not only to a specified element, but also to its descendants. Inheritance relies on the document tree, which is the hierarchy of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/(X)HTML">(X)HTML</a> elements in a page based on nesting. Descendant elements may inherit CSS property values from any ancestor element enclosing them. In general, descendant elements inherit text-related properties, but box-related properties are not inherited. Properties that can be inherited are color, font, letter-spacing, line-height, list-style, text-align, text-indent, text-transform, visibility, white-space and word-spacing. Properties that cannot be inherited are background, border, display, float and clear, height and width, margin, min- and max-height and -width, outline, overflow, padding, position, text-decoration, vertical-align and z-index.
          Inheritance prevents certain properties from being declared over and over again in a style sheet, allowing the software developers to write less CSS. It enhances faster-loading of web pages by users and enables the clients to save money on bandwidth and development costs.
          </p>
       
         <p>Example of inheritance.<br>
          Given the following style sheet:<br>
          h1 {<br>
             color: pink;<br>
          }<br>
          Suppose there is an h1 element with an emphasizing element (em) inside:<br>
          h1><br>
             This to <em>illustrate</em> inheritance<br>
          /h1><br>
          If no color has been assigned to the em element, the emphasized word "illustrate" will inherit the color of the parent element, h1. The style sheet h1 has the color pink, hence, the em element will likewise be in pink.

        <h3>How do I include CSS Styling in my web page?</h3>
      </div>
        </div>            
         <div class="concept-description">
          <p>There are three ways you can do this.<br>
          Method 1: write CSS in the <head> of your HTML (not recommended)<br>
          Method 2: Link your HTML to a separate CSS file (Best way)<br>
          This adds another step, but it lets you stay more organized when working on larger projects. <br>
          To do this: <br>
          1. Write all of your structural HTML in one file (let's call it main.html). <br>
          2. In a separate file (let's call it main.css), put all of your CSS code. <br>
          3. Add a head> element to the top of your HTML. <br>
          4. Add a link> tag inside the head> element. Since link> is a "void tag" you don't need to add a closing /link>. <br>
          5. Add the following attributes to your link>: <br>* rel="stylesheet" * type="text/css" *href="main.css"<br>
          For example, you would have a main.html file that looked like this:<br>
          (left bracket)head><br>
             (left bracket)link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="main.css"><br>
          (left bracket)/head><br>
          (left bracket)body><br>
            (left bracket)div><br>
              This will have a red background.<br>
            (left bracket)/div><br>
          (left bracket)/body><br>
          and in the same folder you would have a file called main.<br>css like this:<br>
          div {<br>
            background-color : red;<br>
          }<br>
          <br>
          Method 3: Write your style inline with your HTML (not recommended)

        <h3>Avoiding Repetition</h3>
      </div>
        </div>
         <div class="concept-description">        
          <p>Avoiding repetition is important for a variety of reasons.</p>

          <!--Here I want to avoid the repetition of adding line breaks by using CSS to format the paragraph. So this section will go across the page until I can fix it. Maybe with width: 50%; but it might not look good when the page is resized.-->
          
          <p>When programmers don't avoid repetition, <br>
            they will often have to do the same thing over and over. <br>
            This may mean copy and pasting certain style attributes into many HTML elements or rewriting the same code (sometimes with minor differences) many times. This can lead to errors when the programmer decides to make a change to something. If they don't dilligently make that same change everywhere the repeated code appears, problems will arise.
          </p>
      
          <p>Consistency: In this web page, I wanted every lesson to look the same. Instead of manually giving each one the same style, I was able to assign each lesson div the same class and then specify the style for that class in only one place! By avoiding repetion, it's now very easy for me to make changes to this style.

          <p>The font-style CSS property allows italic or oblique faces to be selected within a font-family.<br>
          • Initial value normal<br>
          • Applies to all elements. It also applies to ::first-letter and ::first-line.<br>
          • Inherited yes<br>
          • Media visual<br>
          • Computed value as specified<br>
          • Animatable no<br>
          • Canonical order the unique non-ambiguous order defined by the formal grammar<br>

          <p>Syntax<br>
          How to read CSS syntax.<br>
          Formal syntax: normal | italic | oblique<br>
          font-style: normal<br>
          font-style: italic<br>
          font-style: oblique<br>
          font-style: inherit<br>
          </p>
        
          <p>Values<br>
          Italic forms are generally cursive in nature while oblique faces are typically sloped versions of the regular face. Oblique faces can be simulated by artificially sloping the glyphs of the regular face.<br>
            normal<br>
              Selects a font that is classified as normal within a font-family
            italic<br>
              Selects a font that is labeled italic, if that is not available, one labeled blique<br>
            oblique<br>
              Selects a font that is labeled oblique<br>
          </p>
        
          <p>A Slightly Different Example of font-style<br>
          The example shows the different font-style values. The CSS looks like this:<br>
          <br>
          p.normal { font-style:normal } <br>
          p.italic { font-style:italic } <br>
          p.oblique { font-style: oblique }<br>

         <div class="concept-description">
          <p>If you want to write CSS that makes all h1 elements have a black background and white text, you would write:<br>
          h1 {<br>
            background-color : black;<br>
            color: white;<br>
          }
          </p>
          <p>In this example, the h1 is a selector. It says to the browser "I want you to apply the rules I'm about to tell you to every h1 element."
          After the h1 there is a left curly brace { and at the bottom there is a matching right curly brace }. Everything between these curly braces will be interpreted as a "rule" that should be applied to everyh1 element.
          The line of code that says background-color : black; is a declaration. background-color is a propertyand black is the value of that property.

            Default CSS Settings<br>
            Most browsers will display the article element with the following default values:<br>
            article { <br>
                display: block;<br>
            }<br>
            From: <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_article.asp">w3schools Tag article</a>
            </p>

          <p>Selecting by class<br>
            In the example above, we set the background-color of every h1 to black. If we only want to add style to certain h1s, we can use class selectors. Try copying the following code into scratchpad.io to see how this works.<br>
            (left bracket)div class="stop">(left bracket)/div><br>
            (left bracket)div class="slow">(left bracket)/div><br>
            (left bracket)div class="go">(left bracket)/div><br>
            (left bracket)style><br>
            div {<br>
              height : 50px;<br>
              width : 50px;<br>
              border-radius: 25px;<br>
            }<br>
            .stop {<br>
              background-color: red;<br>
            }<br>

            }<br>
            .go {<br>
              background-color: green;<br>
            }<br>
            (left bracket)/style><br>
            We should see a traffic light. Note how in the style element we refer to an HTML element's class name by writing .class-name<br>
            Also note how we can apply rules to all divs or just certain divs by using the appropriate selector.<br>

        <h3>Modular</h3>

         <div class="concept-description">
          <p>
          In programming, it's not always enough that what you make works. There are other qualities that good software should have. In this work session, you'll be making your code more modular.<br>
          In modular code, the "data" is separated from its visual presentation so you can change one without worrying about the other. In the case of your web page, this means that you should be able to keep the raw text of your notes (the data) in one place, and the structure (HTML) and visual presentation (CSS) somewhere else.<br>
          In this part of the work session you will write code that takes a single long string of text and outputs it as HTML.<br>
          Doing this will require...<br>
            • breaking a big task into smaller pieces<br>
            • using functions that you (or others) have already written<br>
            • writing new functions to solve pieces of the bigger problem<br>
            • putting the "pieces" together to solve the bigger problem<br>
          This is exactly what systems thinking is and it's one of the ways you're learning to think like a programmer.<br>
          You will accomplish this in 5 steps.<br>
            1. Understand the "requirements" of the problem. What are the inputs and what should the outputs be?<br>
            2. Plan an approach to solving the problem.<br>
            3. Re-familiarize yourself with code you've already written that may be useful in solving the problem.<br>
            4. Write new code to solve other pieces of the problem.<br>
          Put all the pieces together!<br>
          <br>
          Step 1: Understand the Problem<br>
          With modularity in mind, the goal of this work session is to write code that takes text input and produces HTML output.<br>

           <h3>Assign a Variable</h3>
          </div>
        </div>
         <div class="concept-description">            
          <p>A variable is a name that refers to a value. In Python, we can use any sequence of letters and numbers and underscores (_) we want to make a variable name, so long as it does not start with a number. <br>
          To introduce a new variable, we use an assignment statement:<br>
          Name = Expression<br>
          After executing an assignment expression, the name refers to the value of the expression on the right side of the assignment:
          speed_of_light = 299792458<br>
          We can use the variable name anywhere we want and it means the same things as the value it refers to. Here is an expression using the name to print out the speed of light in centimeters:
          print speed_of_light * 100<br>
          </p>
          
          <p>
          You can create new variables to keep track of values in programs. <br>
          Here is an expression to find the length of the nanostick in centimeters:<br>
          speed_of_light = 299792458<br>
          billionth = 1.0 / 1000000000<br>
          nanostick = speed_of_light * billionth * 100<br>
          print nanostick<br>
          <br>
          Given the variables defined below, write Python code that prints out the distance, in meters, that light travels in one processor cycle. <br>
          Compute this by dividing the speed of light by the number of cycles per second.<br>
          speed_of_light = 299792458 # meters per second<br>
          cycles_per_second = 27000000000. # 2.7GHz<br>
          </p>

           <h3>Variables Can Vary</h3>
          </div>
        </div>
         <div class="concept-description">            
          <p>
          The value a variable refers to can change. When a variable name is used, it always refers to the last value assigned to that variable.<br>
          For example, we can change the value of cycles_per_second. Suppose we have a faster processor:<br>
          speed_of_light = 299792458 # meters per second<br>
          cycles_per_second = 27000000000. # 2.7GHz<br>
          cycle_distance = speed_of_light / cycles_per_second<br>
          cycle_per_second = 2800000000. # 2.8 GHz<br>
          print cycle_distance<br>
          0.111.34243704<br>
          cycle_distance = speed_of_light/ cycles_per_second<br>
          print cycle_distance<br>
          0.107068735<br>
          Since the value that a variable refers to can change, the same exact expression can have different values at the different times it is executed.

         <div class="concept-description">            
          <p>A string is a sequence of characters surrounded by quotes; either single or double.<br>
          'I am a string!'<br>
          The only requirement is that the string must start and end with the same kind of quote.<br>
          "I prefer double quotes!"<br>
          This allows you to include quotes inside of quotes as a character in the string.<br>
          "I'm happy I started with a double quote!"<br>
          Using the interpreter, notice how the color of the input changes before and after you put quotes on both sides of the string.<br>
          What happens when you do not include any quotes:
          print Hello<br>
          Without the quotes, Python reads Hello as a variable that is undefined:<br>
          NameError: name 'Hello' is not defined<br>
          As we saw above, Python will not print an undefined variable, which is why we get the name error.

           We can also use the plus operator (+) on strings, but it has a different meaning from when it is used on numbers. With string, plus means concatenation.<br>
           (left bracket)string> + string> outputs the concatenation of the two strings.<br>
           Try concatenating the string 'Hello' to name.<br>
           You can create a space between the strings by adding a space to one of the strings. You can also continue to add strings as many times as you need.<br>
           name = 'Dave'<br>
           print 'Hello ' + name + '!' + '!' + '!'<br>
           Hello Dave!!!<br>
           However, you cannot use the plus operator to combine strings and integers, as in the case of:<br>
           print 'My name is ' + 9<br>
           When you run this program you should see an error message like this:<br>
           TypeError: cannot concatenate 'str' and 'int' objects.
           It is a bit surprising that you can multiply strings and integers!<br>
           print '!' * 12<br>
           !!!!!!!!!!!!<br>
           This program multiplies the string by the integer to return 12 exclamation points!

           <h3>Indexing Strings</h3>

            When you want to select sub-sequences from a string, it is called indexing. Use the square brackets [] to specify which part of the string you want to select.<br>
            (left bracket) string>[expression>]
            For example, if we have the string 'udacity' and we want to select the character in the zero position (that is, the first character), we would write:<br>
            'udacity'[0]<br>
            The positions in a string are numbered starting with 0, so this evaluates to'u'.<br>
            Indexing strings is the most useful when the string is given using a variable:<br>
            'udacity'[0]   Prints: 0<br>
            'udacity'[1 +1 ]  Prints: 'a'<br>
            name = 'Dave'<br>
            name[0] Prints: 'D'<br>
            When you use negative numbers in the index it starts counting from the back of the string:<br>
            name = 'Dave'<br>
            print name[-1]<br>
            e<br>
            or,<br>
            name='Dave'<br>
            print name[-2]<br>
            v<br>
            When you try to index a character in a position where there is none, Python produces an error indicating that the index is out of range:<br>
            name = 'Dave'<br>
            print name[4]<br>
            IndexError: string index out of range<br>
            <br>
            In the exercises; when it says s = '(left bracket) any string>', it means that the pairs of answers must be equal for every possible string you could make s equal to.
            In particular, you should be careful with so-called "edge cases" which are things like when s is the empty string, a string containing no characters at all, that is, s="". You should also think about short strings like s = "a" or longer strings such as s = "The rain in Spain falls mainly on the plains."

          You can select a sub-sequence of a string by designating a starting position and an end position. Python reads the characters positions starting at 0, so that if we consider the string 'udacity' that has 7 characters, there are 6 positions with 'u' being in the 0 position.<br>
          (left bracket) string>[expression>] is a one-character string<br>
          (left bracket) string>[start expression>:stop expression>] <br>
          is a string that is a sub-sequence of the characters in the string, from the start position up to the character before the stop position. If the start expression is missing, the sub-sequence starts from the beginning of the string; if the stop expression is missing, the sub-sequence goes to the end of the string.<br>
          <br>
          Examples:<br>
          word = 'assume'<br>
          print word[3]<br>
          u<br>
          print word[4:6]<br>
          me<br>
          print word[4:]<br>
          me<br>
          print word[:2]<br>
          as<br>
          print word[:]<br>

            The find method is a built in operation, or method, provided by Python, that operates on strings. The output of find is the position of the string where the specified sub-string is found.<br>
            (left bracket) search string>.find(target string>)<br>
            If the target string is not found anywhere in the search string, then the output will be -1.<br>
            Here are some examples (try them yourself in the interpreter):<br>
            pythagoras = 'There is geometry in the humming of the strings, there is music in the spacing of the spheres. '<br>
            print pythagoras.find('string')<br>
            40<br>
            print pythagoras[40:]<br>
            strings, there is music in the spacing of the spheres.<br>
            print pythagoras.find('T')<br>
            0<br>
            print pythagoras.find('sphere')<br>
            86<br>
            print pythagoras[86:]<br>
            spheres<br>
            print pythagoras.find('algebra')<br>
            -1

            In addition to passing in a target string to find, we can also pass in a number:
            (left bracket)search string>.find(target string>, number>)<br>
            The number input is the position in the search string where find will start looking for the target string. So, the output is a number giving the position of the first occurrence of the target string in the search string at or after the number input position. If there is no occurrence at or after that position, the output is -1.<br>
            For example:<br>
            danton = "De l'audace, encore de l'audace, toujours de l'audace."<br>
            print danton.find('audace')<br>
            5<br>
            print danton.find('audace', 0)<br>
            5<br>
            print danton.find('audace', 5)<br>
            5<br>
            print danton.find('audace', 6)<br>
            25<br>
            print danton.find('audace', 25)<br>
            25<br>
            print danton.find('audace', 48)<br>
            47<br>
            <br>
            Two single quotes with nothing between is called the "empty string". According to Python every string begins with the empty string (which is weird, but sorta makes sense if you think about it).<br>
            <br>
            The result of the find method is to return a number that is the first position in the string where it found requested string.  But because it is a number, you can add numbers.  So to resolve: s.find(s + "!!!') + 1 means that since you can't find the s + !!! inside of s then it becomes -1; and -1 + 1 = 0, so the answer is 0.

            A web page is really just a long string of characters. Your browser renders the web page in a way that looks more attractive than just the string of characters. You can view the string of characters for any web page in your browser. How to do this depends on the browser you are using. For Chrome and Firefox, right-click anywhere on the page that is not a link and select "View Page Source". For Internet Explorer, right-click and select "View Source".

          If you find you get this error "IndentationError: unexpected indent," when you try to test run the code, check that your "print" line does not have any spaces or tabs in front of it. Spacing before the first character on a line is very important in Python. You'll learn more about this as the course goes on.<br>
          "Print" will also ignore multiple spaces after the command and before the next thing.<br>
          It will error out if there are spaces between numbers; or if there are mixed type, like a number 2 and the word two on the same line.

          Procedures (or Functions)<br>
          <br>
          A procedure takes inputs and produces outputs. It is an abstraction that provides a way to use the same code to operate on different data by passing in that data as its inputs.<br>
          <br>
          Defining a procedure:<br>
          def (left bracket)Name>((left bracket)Parameters>):<br>
                (left bracket)Block><br>
          <br>
          The (left bracket)Parameters> are the inputs to the procedure. There is one (left bracket)Name> for each input in order, separated by commas. There can be any number of parameters (including none).<br>
          <br>
          To produce outputs:<br>
          return (left bracket)Expression>, (left bracket)Expression>, ...<br>
          <br>
          There can be any number of expressions following the return (including none, in which case the output of the procedure is the special value None).<br>
          <br>
          Using a procedure:<br>
          (left bracket)''Procedure''>((left bracket)Input>, (left bracket)Input>, ...)<br>
          <br>
          The number of inputs must match the number of parameters. The value of each input is assigned to the value of each parameter name in order, and then the block is evaluated.<br>
          <br>
          On the first line of your function definition...<br>
            • You must begin the line with def (lowercase).<br>
            • After def you must give a function name (in this case it will be udacify.<br>
            • Next, you must have a set of parentheses with the required parameters inside.<br>
            • The line must end with a : colon.<br>
            <br>
          In the body of the function<br>
            • Every line in the function must be indented.<br>
            • If you want your function to produce output, it must end with a return statement.<br>
            <br>
          To "call" the function...<br>
          "Calling" a function just means using it. You do this by writing:<br>
            1. The function name, followed by...<br>
            2. ...an open paren (, followed by...<br>
            3. ...the values for the required parameters, followed by...<br>
            4. ...a closed paren ).<br>
            <br>
          To display the results of a function call use a print statement.<br>
          <br>
          Don't forget to include the print command before you call your function if you want to display the result on your screen!<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          Procedures - a way to package code so it can be reused with different inputs.<br>
          <br>
          Control - a way to have the computer execute different instructions depending on the data (instead of just executing instructions one after the other).<br>
          <br>
          The way to use a procedure—we need the name of the procedure, followed by a left paren, followed by a list of inputs.<br>
          There could be any number of inputs, but it has to match the number of inputs the procedure expects.<br>
          These inputs are sometimes called "operands."<br>
          They are sometimes called "arguments."<br>
          <br>
          Let's see how that works with a simple procedure.<br>
          <br>
          I am going to define the procedure "rest(u>of(u>string," and we'll give it the(/u>(/u> parameter "s," so that means it takes one input and we are going to use the name "s" to refer to the value of that input.<br>
          <br>
          We'll make it "return to string" from the first character to the end.<br>
          We will use the "string" indexing operator "return s [1:]."<br>
          This will evaluate to the "string," with the first letter removed, so all "strings" from position 1 until the end of the "string."<br>
          That's what we return.<br>
          <br>
          So, the output of "rest(u>of(u>string," is that new string that starts from(/u>(/u> the second letter in the input "string."<br>
          <br>
          Here's an example of how to use this procedure.<br>
          We could call it directly.<br>
          <br>
          We could say "print rest(u>of(u>string."(/u>(/u><br>
          That's our procedure.<br>
          <br>
          Now we are going to have our paren and we are going to pass in an input.<br>
          There's one parameter to "rest(u>of(u>string," so we need one input</u></u> to pass in and it should be a "string."<br>
          <br>
          We'll pass in the "string" audacity.<br>
          What happens when we call a procedure like this, execution will jump into the body of the procedure. We can think of what the interpreter is doing now. Instead of running the code here, the interpreter will move. When we call a procedure, it will jump to run the code inside the procedure. It will assign to the parameters the values passed in as the inputs. We can think of this as there being an assignment that says now the value of "s" is the value of this input that was passed in.<br>
          Now we are going to evaluate the body of the procedure.
          In this case there's only one statement—it's this return statement.<br>
          We are going to find this value, so s [1:].<br>
          The result of that is going to be the "string" udacity.<br>
          Then we got to the return.<br>
          What return means is we're going to jump back.<br>
          <br>
          We're jumping back to where we called the procedure, but now we actually have a result. When we jump back, the value that this evaluates to is whatever value we returned.<br>
          In this case, it's the "string udacity."

          The sum procedure does not actually change the values of the inputs. In fact, it is impossible to write a procedure that changes the value of an integer or string input, since these types are immutable. That means that once we create an object of an integer or string type, there is nothing that can be done to change the value of that object. For example,<br>
           x = 17<br>
           z = 'hello'<br>
           any_mysterious_procedure(x, z)<br>
          After this code, we know the value of x is still 17 and the value is z is still 'hello' even though we know nothing about what the any_mysterious_procedure does.<br>

           <h3>Using Operators for Doing a Comparison of Values</h3>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="concept-description">
         <p>
          Python provides lots of different operators for doing comparisons.<br>
          There are things similar to what we've used in math.  We have a less than sign that compares 2 numbers.<br>
          We have the greater than.<br>
          We have a less than or equal to. Things like this...<br>
          All of these operate on numbers, so we can have a number followed by a comparison operator, followed by another number.<br>
          This is very similar to the grammar we saw earlier for arithmetic expressions, but now instead of having a plus or times here, we can have something that does a comparison.<br>
          <br>
          The output of a comparison though is not a number.<br>
          It's a Boolean value, and a Boolean value is 1 of 2 things.<br>
          It's either the value True or the value False.<br>
          <br>
          Generally, when we are comparing values, we want them to be the same type. For example, we will usually compare integers with other integers, strings with strings, etc. We can, however, compare two values of different types:<br>
          a = 1<br>
          b = 'hello'<br>
          print a > b<br>
          >>> False<br>
          print b > a<br>
          >>> True<br>
          Seems weird that this works, right? Also, why does Python decide that a string 'hello' is "greater than" 1? This was actually a mistake in Python 2, which has been fixed in Python 3. These comparisons will return consistent, but irrelevant results.<br>
          <br>
          != means not equal to<br>
          So 7 x 3 != 21 is false because 7 x 3 is equal to 21.<br>
          If we want to do equality comparison, we don't use the equal sign, we use 2 equal signs.<br>
          We call that the double equal.<br>
          A single equal sign is an assignment; to assign the item to the right of the equal sign to the item on the left.

           <h3>"OR"</h3>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="concept-description">
         <p>
          The construct "or" gives us the logic "or" of the two operands on its left and right.<br>
          <br>
          So if we have:<br>
          print "True" or "False"<br>
          The value of "True" or "False" is "True"<br>
          <br>
          If we have:<br>
          print "False" or "True"<br>
          That also has the value "True"<br>
          <br>
          print "True" or "True" <br>
          is also "True", but <br>
          print "False" or "False" <br>
          is "False"<br>
          <br>
          And I'm showing these boolean literals.<br>
          This could be any expression we want, like we use the name at position zero here.<br>
          The one important thing that "or" does is different from  other operators It only evaluates what it needs to. So here's an important example: <br>
          So we could say "True" or "this_is_an_error"<br>
          That will also evaluate to "True" even though if I just look at "this_is_an_error" by itself that's an undefinable variable.<br>
          We didn't define the variable "this_is_an_error" but when we evaluate the "or" expression because we already found that the first part was "True", we don't get an error.  If we try to evaluate instead of "True" or "this_is_an_error" if we evaluate "False" or "this_is_an_error" it's necessary to look at the second operand and then we will get an error.<br>
           So let's try that, we are doing "False" or" "this_is_an_error" we get an error because since the first operand was "False", to know whether the "or" is "True" or "False", we need to look at the second operand and that's not defined.<br>
          This behavior of "or" will turn out to be very useful. We'll see other places where we rely on the second operand not getting evaluated if the first one is "True".<br>
          <br>
          So to summarize, here's what the "or" construct looks like.  So if the first expression evaluates to "True" then the value of the "or" construct is "True" and there's no need to evaluate the second expression, and in fact the Python interpreter does not evaluate it.
          If the value of the first expression is "False" then the value of the "or" construct is the value of the second expression.

      <h2>List Data Type</h2>

        <div class="concept-description">
         <p>
          Lists are much more powerful than strings, so whereas for a string, all of the elements had to be characters, in a list, the elements can be anything we want.<br>
          They could be characters. They could be strings.<br>
          They could be numbers. They could also be other lists.<br>
          When we created a string, we just put a sequence of characters surrounded by either single or double quotes.<br>

           <h3>Structure of a List</h3>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="concept-description">
         <p>
          With a list, instead of using quotes to identify the list we use square brackets, and the elements are separated by commas.  And just like with a string, we can assign the list that we create to a variable.<br>
          <br>
          With a string, we could use the square brackets to select elements, and when we index element 0, we'll get the first element of the string, a sequence of that character.<br>
          <br>
          With lists, we can also use square brackets to access elements, so if we do p[0], that will evaluate to the first element of p, which for a string element is the string containing a single letter.<br>
          <br>
          With strings, we saw that we could use the colon inside the square brackets to select a sub string of more than 1 character.<br>
          p [2:4] Here we're selecting from position 2 through position 4.
          That will give us the third and fourth characters of the string.
          We can do the same thing with lists.<br>
          We can select from position 2 to position 4, but instead of returning a string, it will return a list containing those elements. It will give us a list of the third and fourth element of the variable p.<br>
          <br>
          The general grammar for constructing a list is to have a square bracket followed by a list of any number of expressions where the expressions are separated by commas.<br>
          We could create a list using just 2 brackets, a left bracket and a right bracket, and this would create a list containing 0 elements, also known as the empty list.<br>
          <br>
          We could create a list containing 1 element.<br>
          That would be the square brackets with 1 element between them.<br>
          Or we could create a list with many elements.<br>

It's complaining that the list index is out of range. That means we've tried to find an element in a list that doesn't exist, and we did it exactly at this point where we're returning days_in_month of month - 1, and the value of month was 13. There's no element at position 12 because days_in_month only has 12 elements.<br>
          <br>
          You can have a list go across more than one typed line, just end the line with a , comma, and it helps to indent so you can easily read it.<br>
          Index an index so you can get the item in a particular position.<br>

         <div class="concept-description">
          <p>
          Differences between strings and lists.<br>
          In strings, the elements can only be characters, while lists can be any data type.<br>
          Lists support Mutations.<br>
          When you assign a string to a new value, it doesn't change the original string, it just points to a new string.  And we have lost the ability to access the old string because there isn't a variable that refers to it.<br>
          <br>
          # We defined:<br> 
          stooges = ['Moe','Larry','Curly']<br>
           <br>
          # but in some Stooges films, Curly was<br>
          # replaced by Shemp.<br>
          # Write one line of code that changes<br>
          # the value of stooges to be:<br>
           <br>
          print stooges[3]='Shemp'<br>
           <br>
          ['Moe','Larry','Shemp']<br>
           <br>
          # but does not create a new List<br>
          # object.<br>
           <br>
          stooges[2]='Shemp'<br>
          print stooges<br>
           <br>
          ['Moe', 'Larry', 'Shemp']<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          p = ['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']<br>
          q = p<br>
          p[0] = 'Y'<br>
          print q<br>
          ['Y', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']<br>
           <br>
           <br>
          Aliasing: Two ways to refer to the same object<br>
          In the above example p = a list; q=p sets q to p, and since a list is mutable it makes both p and q refer to the same list.<br>
          <br>
          p = ['J', 'a', 'm', 'e', 's']<br>
          q = p<br>
          p[2]='n' # changes the list for both p and q; however, <br>
          p=[0,0,7] # only changes the list for p, but not for q, which retains Janes.<br>
          So when changing a single element in a list will change the list; reassigning one of the variables that refers to a list only changes the value of the reassigned variable, and not any other variable that refers to the original list.<br>
          <br>
          Why what you just learned matters<br>
          When I first took this lesson, I found myself saying "I don't care how all this works! Just show me how to use it!"<br>
          I was frustrated by what felt like unnecessary details about how Python works. But now I really appreciate that Dave included this in his course.<br>
          Learning how technology actually works is how you build your technological empathy. This empathy will help you diagnose and fix bugs that otherwise would have been a mystery to you.<br>
          For example, sometime in the future you will be writing a program and you will find that a variable does not have the value you expected. The cause may be that you changed the value of a variable that you thought was different but actually wasn't (due to the aliasing you just learned about).<br>
          And now, you'll be able to fix that problem. And you know a bit more about how Python works!<br>
          <br>

          # Define a procedure, replace_spy,<br>
          # that takes as its input a list of<br>
          # three numbers, and modifies the<br>
          # value of the third element in the<br>
          # input list to be one more than its<br>
          # previous value.<br>
           <br>
          spy = [0,0,7]<br>
          p = spy<br>
           <br>
          def replace_spy(p):<br>
           <br>
              p[2] = p[2] +1<br>
              return spy<br>
           <br>
          # In the test below, the first line calls your <br>
          # procedure which will change spy, and the <br>
          # second checks you have changed it.<br>
          # Uncomment the top two lines below.<br>
           <br>
          replace_spy(spy)<br>

          print p<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          Geo:  This also works; however it’s better to use a variable inside the def to keep things easier to debug.<br>
          <br>
          spy = [0,0,7]<br>

          append: will add a new element to the end of a list.<br>
          append is a method, similar to find with strings.<br>
          It mutates the list it is invoked on, meaning it changes the list, not creating a new list with new values.<br>
          <br>
          Plus + is another operation like concatenation for strings. It operates on two lists to merge the contents; not mutating to create a new list, but adds the contents of both lists.<br>
          len is for length, and it is an operator that can work on anything with a collection of things, like a string or a list.<br>
           <br>
          p = [1,2]           # [1,2]<br>
          p.append(3)    # [1,2,3]<br>
          p = p + [4,5]    #[1,2,3,4,5]<br>

            In part 1 you will attempt 3 problems dealing with lists.<br>
              1. Exploring List Properties: You'll explore the difference between concatenating two lists with the+ operator and appending with .append(). You'll also be introduced to a new operator +=.<br>
              2. Product List: You'll write code that multiplies all the numbers in a list together.<br>
              3. Greatest: You'll write code that takes a list of numbers and returns the greatest number.<br>

            Practice: Part 2<br>
            Now you're going to write some functions which will help you do what you did in the previous work session more easily.
            At the end of the last work session, you saw how to take a string like this: <br>
            """TITLE: title 1<br>
            DESCRIPTION: description 1<br>
            TITLE: title 2<br>
            DESCRIPTION: description 2<br>
            TITLE: title 3<br>
            DESCRIPTION: description 3"""<br>
            and turn it into HTML.<br>
            But that's not a great way to do this. It's very fragile and relies on a very specific syntax (for example, the code looked for the substring TITLE:, and wouldn't work if you had forgotten the colon).<br>
            It would be better if we could turn a data structure like this into HTML:<br>
            [['title 1', 'description1'],<br>
             ['title 2', 'description2'],<br>

              <p>If you find you are getting 0 when you run your code, try changing the values to decimals.<br>
              When you divide an integer (number without a decimal) by another integer, Python does something called integer division which means it ignores the decimal part of the answer. For example, 5/2 gives 2 instead of 2.5, and 1/10 gives 0 instead of 0.1.<br>
              To force Python to give you an answer including a decimal, you need to make one of the numbers into a decimal by putting a decimal point after it. For example, 5/2.0 gives 2.5, and so does 5.0/2. Try experimenting in the interpreter so that you get a feel of how it works. For example, type<br>
              print 5/2<br>
              and then press the "Test Run" button to see what happens. Then try<br>
              print 5.0/2<br>
              and see what you get then.

              </p>
              <p>Here's a more detailed explanation of the Python code here:299792458 * 100 * 1.0/1000000000 * 1/2.7 The first term is the speed of light in meters per second (this is actually exact - a meter is defined as "the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1/299 792 458 of a second.".<br>
              The second term, 100 is the number of centimeters in a meter.<br>
              The third term, 1.0/1000000000 is one billionth. (Note that we need the.0 here (or at least 1.) to make Python do floating point division.Otherwise, 1/1000000000 would evaluate to 0.)<br>
              So, the first three terms in the product compute the distance in centimeters that light travels in one billionth of a second (or one nanosecond). To compute the number of nanoseconds per cycle for my 2.7 GHz processor, the fourth term is 1 / 2.7. Since there are 2.7 Billion cycles per second, there are 2.7 cycles per nanosecond, and each cycle takes 1 / 2.7 nanoseconds.

        <div class="concept-description">
          <p>
          We went over 5 debugging strategies in this lesson.<br>
            1. Examine error messages when programs crash<br>
          The last line of Python Tracebacks will tell you what went wrong. Reading backwards from there will tell you more about where the problem occurred.<br>
            2. Work from example code<br>
          If your modified code doesn't work, comment it out and do step-by-step modifications to the example code until it does what you want.  Split up the function into pieces, and look at what the variables are doing in each of the pieces.<br>
            3. Make sure examples work<br>
          Just because you find example code doesn't mean it will work in your system. Check the example code you're using to make sure it behaves the way you expect.<br>
            4. Check (print) intermediate results<br>
          When your code doesn't crash, but doesn't behave as expected, add print statements to your program to see where in the code things stop behaving correctly.<br>
          When adding print statements for debugging, "say" what you are printing:<br>
          print "# location", location)<br>
            5. Keep and compare old versions<br>
          When you have a working version of your code, save it before you add to the code. This will give you something to go back to if you introduce too many new bugs.<br>
          <br>
          Git ; a program that allows you to go back to any previous version of the code.<br>
          <br>

  </div>
    <div class="concept-description">  
      <p>The gap between beginning to learn something (novice stage) <br>
      to being fluent (becoming an expert) is to think of <br>
      the journey as a continuum of expertise.

      <div class="concept-description">        
        <p>Ignorance (not knowing)<br>
        Awareness (exposed to something new)<br>
        Ability (acting on the new knowledge)<br>
        Fluency (acting correctly without thinking about how, automatic)
        </p>
      
        <p>Confusion and frustration are normal when learning something new, especially programming.  <br>
        However, be careful that they don't lead to disappointment, or anger, or terror, or worse.

      </div>
        </div>
         <div class="concept-description">        
          <p>1) ask for help<br>
          Use Google search<br>
          Use Udacity discussion forums<br>
          Ask other classmates<br>
          Getting things installed and working can often be one of the most frustrating parts of programming and even professional programmers struggle with these things.<br>
          2) take a break<br>
          3) just keep going on to the next section, which has the answers<br>
          accept a little temporary confusion</p>
          <p>When listening to experts, ask questions even if they seem basic.  <br>
          An expert may forget what it was like to be a beginner and learn something complicated.  <br>
          They might:<br>
          a) assume you have knowledge that you don't<br>
          b) use jargon you don't understand<br>
          c) speak too quickly for you to understand.

Those will be input to another program which is a Python interpreter that follows the instructions in your code and it does that by following the instruction in its code... and you'll be able to run all that using your web browser."<br>
          Hidden in these two sentences are examples of 3 of the 5 ways you can think like a programmer:<br>
          1. The line "...follows the instructions in your code..." references the <b>procedural thinking</b> required of programmers.<br>
          2. The entire quote demonstrates a deep <b>technological empathy</b> (which you don't need to have at this point) for how computers and programs work.<br>
          3. When Dave thinks of a Python program, a Python interpreter, and a web browser as different versions of the same thing (a computer program) he's showing <b>abstract thinking</b>.<br>
          Now you're about to write your very first computer program. Don't worry if it doesn't work as expected to begin with, computer programs often don't!<br>
          4. <b>Debugging</b> is one of the five ways programmers think. Python requires code be written with a very specific syntax. This means that small typos can lead to big problems!<br>
          The trick to dealing with programming mistakes (called "bugs") is not to avoid making them entirely. That's impossible. The trick is to develop a system for finding and fixing them.

          <p>Understanding a Computational Problem<br>
            <br>
            A problem is defined as by 1) possible inputs (set), and their relationship between 2) desired outputs<br>
            <br>
            A Solution is to take the inputs, apply a procedure, and get the outputs.<br>
            <br>
            Problem example: Given your birthday and the current date, calculate your age in days.<br>
            <br>
            Steps:<br>
            0) Dont' Panic!<br>
            <br>
            1) What are the inputs?  <br>
            Inputs: two dates (Given your birthday and the current date...)
            What is the set of valid inputs? (Assumptions; if not spelled out in the problem.)<br>
            a) the second date must not be before the first date; check for this in our code <br>
            <br>
            (Defensive Programming)<br>
            b) use the Gregorian calendar, established 15 Oct, 1582<br>
            c) assume no time travel<br>
            <br>
            How are the inputs represented?<br>
            def daysBetweenDates(year1, month1, day1, year2, month2, day2):<br>
            <br>
            2) What are the outputs?<br>
            (...calculate your age in days.)<br>
            How should we specify the output?  Return a number giving the number of days between the first date and the second date.<br>
            <br>
            3) Understand the relationships between the inputs and the outputs using examples.<br>
            a) Reword the problem into a problem statement that looks like psuedo code:<br>
            "Define a procedure, daysBetweenDates, that takes tow days as inputs and returns the number of days between the first date and second date.  Each date is passed in as three numbers giving a valid year, month, and day in the Gregorian calendar.  <br>
            <br>
            The second date must not be before the first."<br>
            b) work out on paper some examples of inputs; consider systematically how a human solves a problem<br>
            daysBetweenDates(2012, 12, 7, 2012, 12, 7) # same day: 0<br>
            daysBetweenDates(2012, 12, 7, 2012, 12, 8) # next day: 1<br>
            daysBetweenDates(2012, 12, 8, 2012, 12, 7) # previous day: undefined<br>
            daysBetweenDates(2012, 6, 29, 2013, 6, 29) # one year, non leap year: 365<br>
            daysBetweenDates(2012, 6, 29, 2013, 6, 31) # invalid days, no 31 in month 6: undefined<br>
            daysBetweenDates(2013, 1, 24, 2013, 6, 29) # several months, non leap year<br>
            <br>
            Count the days by hand:<br>
            Jan 24-Jan 31 = 7<br>
            + Feb = 28<br>
            + March = 31<br>
            + April = 30<br>
            + May =   31<br>
            + June 1-29 =   29<br>
            Total:  156<br>
            <br>
            daysBetweenDates(2013, 1, 24, 2024, 6, 29) # same example, add several years days in years:<br>
            2013: 365<br>
            2014: 365<br>
            ...<br>
            2024: 366<br>
            Total: (366, leap year)<br>
            Add up the extra years.<br>
            <br>
            Start with an algorithm or "pseudo code":<br>
            days = # of days in month1 - day1 (for 2013, 1, 24 there are 31 days in Jan, minus the start day of 24 equals 7)<br>
            month1 += 1<br>
            while month1 < month2:<br>
              days += # of days in month1<br>
              month1 += 1<br>
            days += day2<br>
            while year1 < year2:<br>
              days += days in year1<br>
            <br>
            This code doesn't handle:<br>
            - input dates in same month<br>
            - month2 < month1, year2 > year1 # invalid input year<br>
            - counting days in leap years<br>
            Don't implement this psuedo code, try to find a simpler way.<br>
            <br>
            4) Apply a Simple mechanical solution<br>
            <br>
            5) Develop incrementally and test as we go<br>
            <br>
            Pseudo code:<br>
            days = 0<br>
            while date1 is before date2<br>
              date1 = advance to next day<br>
              days += 1<br>
            return days<br>
            <br>
            Don't optimize prematurely! Simple and Correct<br>
            <br>
            Quiz: What should we write first:<br>
            daysBetweenDates # to solve whole problem<br>
            nextDay(year, month, day) # to get next day for simple case<br>
            isLeapYear(year) # to determine if year is leap year<br>
            daysInMonth(month) # to get the number of days in a month<br>
            <br>
            Define a procedure:<br>
            nextDay(year, month, day) <br>
            that takes as input a valid date in the Gregorian calendar encoded as the year, month, and day as numbers, and returns the next day as a year, month, day.<br>
            (Assume: all months have 30 days.)<br>
            <br>
            ###<br>

            In order to answer this question, you should think about the dependencies between the various steps, but also about what order of implementing and testing them will be most likely to efficiently lead to a correct solution.<br>
            It's definitely a subjective question, and there are many reasonable answers to this question. Because of this, your answer will not be graded.<br>

        <p>
        Steps to Take: <br>
        1. Understand the problem; schedule breaks throughout the day, reminding you to take a break by listening to music, get up and dance to their favorite song, or just walk away from the computer every once in a while.<br>
        2. Define the inputs: start_time; elapsed_time; break_interval; break_frequency.<br>
        3. Understand the output; take a break, music, dance, walk away<br>
        4. Understand the relationship between inputs and output; run program; keep track of time; after 2 hours elapsed time; open browser to play a favorite song; after two more hours it prompts you to take another break.<br>
        5. Write pseudo code for how a human might do it; set alarm clock to alarm time, wait, turn off alarm.<br>
        6. Write code, test, debug, refine, iterate, complete.<br>
        Then take breaks when it tell me to.<br>

      <h2>Classes</h2>
    </div>
     <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
        Student Note: Reading over my notes so far I notice that some of the information, while accurate, is a bit complicated.  Its missing the flavor of the course, and the context, which makes it difficult to absorb.  So for my notes in Stage 3 I decided to include the text from the class.  In the future, when I go back to read this and use the new learning, it will make it more accessible to have the full flavor and context that was originally presented. At least that's the theory. :) <br>
        What to do with the code files; well I added them to the images folder, thinking it would get zipped, that way the instructor could see it.
        <br>
        <br>
        So, before we continue with this project, I want to highlight a few new words that we have used in the code thus far. We've identified turtle as a class. And brad and angie as instances of that class. Now, I want to take a moment and talk about these new words. <br>
        You can think of a class as a blueprint of a building. Now, a blueprint as we know, contains certain pieces of information about the building. For instance, the height of the building, the number of rooms in the building. We also know that the same blueprint can be used to build multiple different buildings. For instance, an office with yellow walls, and a residential complex with blue walls. A class is like a blueprint. <br>
        So let's take the example of class Turtle that we've used thus far. A class Turtle, much like a blueprint, contains certain pieces of information about the turtle. The turtle's size, its color, the fact that the turtle can move forward and turn right. And from this class, or blueprint we can create multiple different instances of that class. For example, Brad is an instance of class Turtle that draws a yellow square, and Angie is also an instance of class Turtle that draws a blue circle. <br>
        So, in summation, you can think of a class as a blueprint, and you can think of its objects as example or instances of that blueprint.<br>
        <br>

        When we wanted to use functions previously, we wrote code like webbrowser.open(). <br>
        But when we wanted to create instances of this class, class turtle, we wrote code that said,<br>
        turtle.Turtle(). <br>
        Now, look at both of these statements. They look rather similar. It seems like we're calling a function in both of these cases. But something different is happening behind the scene. When we call webbrowser.open(), all we are doing is calling a function. No big deal. <br>
        But when we call turtle.Turtle(), the init function defined inside class Turtle, that's the function that gets called. And it creates or initializes space inside memory for a new instance which we called brad. Even though it seems like we called functions in both cases, we called open in the first case and the function init, in the second case. <br>
        Not all functions are created equal. <br>
        When we called webbrowser.open(), all we did was call a function, but when we called turtle.Turtle(), it in turn called the init function which created or initialized space in memory that did not exist before. So, that concludes our first example of how to use classes. Let's look at a few more examples.<br>
        Kunal notes, starting at 0:48, the following: "A class Turtle, much like a blueprint, contains certain pieces of information about a turtle: the turtle's size, its color, the fact that the Turtle can move forward..."<br>
        It would be more accurate to say that the class Turtle indicates the fact that it has a size and a color. Individual instances of the Turtle will contain information about their sizes and their colors.<br>
        <br>
        So thus far, we have seen, two examples with classes. One, when we drew shapes using Turtles. And then the other one, when we sent out text messages using Twilio. <br>
        Now, when we created shapes using Turtle.  We hold a line of code that read, brad is equal to turtle.Turtle(). Now, what we are really trying to say with this line of code here, is that inside Python, there is a file called turtle, and inside that file, is a class called turtle. And when we try to access that class using this statement, specially with this, open, close brackets. What we are really doing behind the scenes, is calling the, init function defined inside the class. And what this function init does, is that it initializes, or creates space in memory for a new instance, which we called, brad. <br>
        Brad is an object or instance of the class turtle. This instance brad, can then do things defined inside the class turtle, like, move the turtle forward. <br>
         <br>
        Similarly, when we, write a line of code that says client is equal to, rest.TwilioRestCclient(). What we are really trying to say, is that, inside Twilio, there is a folder called, rest. And inside that folder, is a Python file which has a class called TwilioRestClient. Now, when we call this line of code, the one where we access the class, TwilioRestClient(), with these open-closed brackets, what we are really doing, is calling a function,init. Defined inside that class TwilioRestClient. And what this function init does, is again initializes or creates spaces in memory, for an object or instance of that class, TwilioRestClient.  We call that object, client. 
        The object client, can then do things defined inside that class, TwillioRestClient, like send smses or texts. <br>
         <br>
        So, in summation. You can think of a class, as a blueprint of a building. Now, this blueprint will have certain pieces of information about the building, like a number of rooms in the building, the area under the building etc.  Now we can use the same blueprint, to build multiple buildings. For instance, a residential complex with yellow walls and an office building with, blue walls. 
        Similarly, a class. Let's take the example of class Turtle that we've used thus far. Now, this has information about the turtle, for instance, how to make the turtle move forward, how to make the turtle turn right,etc. <br>
        Now, we can use one class as a blueprint or a template to create, multiple instances like Brad and Angie.  Now, these instances. They can do things that are defined inside our class or blue print.  Things like, move forward, turn right, and draw a circle. <br>
         <br>
        Now, recently, we've seen another class, and this class is called Twilio Rest Client.  Which I have just abbreviated here for lack of space. This class, has information about how to connect with Twillio and send a text message. And from this blueprint we can then create an instance called, client. Client can then do things that are defined inside the class, like, send out texts. <br>
         <br>
        So you can think of a class, as a blueprint, which have some basic information defined inside of them. And you can think of its objects, as examples or instances, of that blueprint.  <br> 
        <br>
        <br>
        1. A Class is a function in code in a file that gets initialized , to create space in memory for a new instance or object, which we can give a name.  <br>
        2. An instance of a class is the named object that can then do things defined inside the code of the class.<br>
        3. Another analogy is that a Class: Vehicle, can have an instance or object: my car.<br>

      <h2>Favorite Movie Website</h2>
    </div>
     <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          Now the output of the program we are about to build will be a movie website with all of your favorite movies, and if you click on one of them its trailer will play.<br>
          <br>
          We will use classes to build this movie website. Let us begin, by recalling what we already know about classes.<br>
          Remember the blueprint analogy? Previously, we had compared a blueprint, to a class. We had said that a blueprint of a building, contains information about the building. Like the number of rooms in the building. The height and the weight of the walls. Now, we can use one blueprint to build several buildings. And these buildings we call instances or examples of that blueprint. <br>
          <br>
          Classes are like a blueprint. Now we've seen previously that a class like Turtle, contains information about what a Turtle can do. For instance, move forward, turn right. And we use that information to create multiple examples or instances of that class. We call them Brad and Angie that drew different shapes. In the same way, we now want to create a class called Movie, which will allow us to create multiple instances of itself, instances like Toy Story and Avatar. So then the next big question in front of us is. <br>
          <br>
          What data should this class Movie contain? Now I'm going to present a list of data points for you, that you can consider. Here they are. Which one of the following do you think the class movie, should remember for each movie?<br>
          <br>
          So the truth is that the class movie can contain whatever we want it to contain. And in this case, I will pick the movie's title, its youtube_trailer, its reviews, the storyline and its poster_image. Now that decision will mean, that if I said something like toy_story.storyline. The program will print this. A story of a boy and his toys that come to life, and if I said, avatar.show_trailer, the program would play avatar's YouTube trailer. <br>
          <br>
          So, in summary, when designing the class Movie, we probably want to remember data like the movie's title, its storyline, its poster image, and the link to its YouTube trailer. And one thing we may want to do with this data, is to have a show trailer function which opens the movie's YouTube trailer.<br>
          <br>
          Okay, so the design of our class Movie, is here on the top right, and I'm going to begin, with a blank programming file. I have named it, media.py, and it is saved inside a folder called, movies. Now, to write a new class, [SOUND] I will used the Python keyword, class. And I will name it, Movie. You've probably notices, that the first letter of the name of the class M, is in uppercase. Now, this letter doesn't necessarily need to be in uppercase, but, the Google style guide for Python suggests that it should be.<br>
          <br>
          Now, what is this thing called the Google style guide for Python you ask, Well, let's Google it. The first link here looks good to me. Now, this Style Guide, provides conventions to programmers all over the world. On how to write their programs. If you scroll down a bit You will notice that there are conventions on everything, from how to name things, to how to write comments. By the way, the link to this webpage, is available in the instructor notes. I recommend that you read through this document. <br>
          If you click on this link called Naming, you will notice that, when defining a class name, Google recommends that the first letter of that name be in capital letters.<br>
          <br>
          Okay, back to the code. Now, thus far, we've encountered one new key word, called class. In fact, we are going to come across several new words in this lesson, and I want to list them all, in one place for handy reference. The word class, is the first one on that list. We will review, all the words on this list before we end this lesson. So, you may have noticed that our class, is empty thus far. Now, to figure out what I want to do next with it, I will go back to my design. So, here I am, back with my class design. Now, I know that eventually, I would want to create multiple instances of the class movie. Instances like, Toy Story and Avatar. I also know that I have previously created instances of class Turtle. Instances like Brad, and to do that, I had to write a piece of code that read, turtle.Turtle, so I guess I will have to write a piece of code like this, to create Toy Story, an instance of class Movie. Let's do that next.<br>
          <br>
          So to find out what happens when we run this line of code, we will go back in time and look at a video from a previous lesson when we were drawing shapes. For now, you can think of a class as a neatly packaged box that puts things together really well. And it allows us to write code like turtle.turtle() with these strange-looking brackets as if we were calling a function. In fact, when we do run this piece of code, we are, in fact, calling a function, a function called init, which is defined inside the class Turtle. <br>
          Init stands for initialize. And what it does is it creates space in memory for a new instance or a new object of the class Turtle. This instance, we called Brad. Okay, so we are back to the present time. 
          <br>
          Now, we started out by defining a file called media.py. Let me place it up on the board. Notice that I place this file outside the Python standard library. Inside that file, we then defined a class called Movie. After that, we wrote a line of code that said media.movie. And what that did, was that it called the init function Define inside class Movie. And that created a new instance. That instance we called Toy Story. <br>
          <br>
          So to summarize, this function init initializes or creates space and memory for the new instance Toy Story. By the way, this new function init, is also called a constructor because it constructs space and memory for the new instance, which in this case happens to be Toy Story. So thus far, we've encountered two new words that we can add to our new word list. The first one is "instance," which in this case, happens to be Toy Story. And the second one is a "constructor," which in this case, is the function init. Now, we will revisit these words soon. But for now, let's define init.<br>
          <br>
          So, here I am, back at the code, and here I can see my class movie, and within it I will begin to define, the function, init.<br>
          <br>
          Now, there is something very curious about this function already, which is that, there are two underscores on both sides of the word in it. These underscores are a way for Python to tell us, the programmers, that hey, the name init, is essentially reserved in Python, and that, this is a special function or method. What's special about init? Is that, it initializes or creates space in memory. To remember details like title, story line, et cetera, for new movies that we are about to create. Now init, takes a few pieces of information or arguments. The first of which, is always the python keyword, self. Now, what is this thing called, self, you ask? Well, you can think of self as itself, or the instance being created. So, when we run this line of code in our other Python file, by the way, just to remind you, here we are trying to create a new movie called, toy_story.<br>
          <br>
          And when we run this line of code, we know that the __init__ function inside the class Movie gets called. Self, in that case, points to toy_story. Now here, I have a confession to make. I remember when I was first learning object oriented programming years ago in college. This concept of self, was really difficult for me to understand. If that is the case with you, don't worry about it too much for now. This will get, really clear when we learn this entire piece of coding a few seconds. In any case, let's add the keyword self, to our list of new words. <br>
          <br>
          def __init__(self):   # two underbars before and after init<br>
          <br>
          Instructor Notes<br>
          Correction: self is not a python keyword. We made a mistake in calling it so. If you change all occurrences of the word "self" to another word, say "udacity" in the media.py file, the code will still work. Go ahead, try it out.<br>
          Even though self is not a keyword, it is a convention that is used by most Python programmers. Using the word self will make your code more readable to other programmers. So we encourage that you do so.<br>
          Check out section 9.4 of the Python documentation for more information. A big thank you to our student Michael Handel for catching this error.<br>
          https://docs.python.org/2.7/tutorial/classes.html#random-remarks<br>
          <br>
          Okay, I'm going to go back to the class movie, and continue to define the function, init. Now, we want init, to initialize pieces of information like title, story line and others that we want to remember inside our class. Here's a way to do that. I will say, self.title, then self.storyline. The next one is, poster_image_url, and finally, trailer_youtube_url. <br>
          <br>
          Now, we have to somehow initialize these variables, with information init is going to receive. And in particular, it's going to receive, four pieces of information. The first of which is, a movie title, next is, the movie storyline, then the poster image of the movie, and finally, the trailer on YouTube. So,get this, once I've received these four pieces of information as arguments to the __init__ function, I can initialize my Movie variables.<br>
          <br>
          Here's how to do that. self.title, is the movie title. Self.storyline, is the movie story line. Next is, the poster image. And finally, the trailer on youtube. Now here, I have a confession to make. Which is, that we've written a lot of code that looks new and strange. Well, the one thing I can say is that, we should all just take a pause and a deep breath together.  For now, all I want you to do, is pause this video, and write down this code on your computer. All of this code will make sense as soon as we run this program. Now, there is one key point I would like to highlight, before I execute this piece of code, which is, that if I go to my other Python file, which is entertainment_center.py. And run this piece of code. It will throw an error. The error will happen, because when we try to create the movie, Toy Story, the init function gets called, which is now looking for several arguments or pieces of information, although, we are not sending it any information whatsoever. So let me change that. <br>
          <br>
          Now, I know that first argument for the edit function is, self. Which is added by default in Python. So I will skip it. The next one is movie title, which I know is, Toy Story, so I will add that. After that, is the movie storyline, so I will type that in next. A Story. Of a boy and his toys that come to life. The next one is, the power image, so I will add that. I had previously gone on Wikipedia and found a link to, Toy Story's poster, so I added that and finally, the Youtube trailer, which I will add also. There it is. Now, let me just scroll back so we can see the beginning of the code. Here, I recognize that you can't see all of the code, so what I've done is, take an image of the code, and put it in the instructor notes for you to look at. All right, the last thing I'm going to do here, is type Toy Story's story line. Let me save this file, and then go back to my class Movie file, and save that one also. And then come back again, to my entertainment_center.py file. Now here, if everything goes correctly, my program should print out, toy_story.storyline. Let's run it. And there it is, Toy story, storyline is getting printed.<br>
          <br>
          Okay, so, in the next video we are going to see what happens behind the scenes when we run this piece of code.<br>
          <br>
          Okay, so here is the code for the class Movie that we have written thus far. Now, bear in mind, that you may have to go into full-screen mode in order to see all of the details here properly. And I'm really curious to figure out what happens behind the scenes when I run this line of code. What happens when I create an instance called toy_story by providing these four pieces of information or arguments. These pieces of information are the name of the movie, its story line, the link to its poster, and the link to its YouTube URL. Now clearly, the last two of these are not really links or URLs just yet. They are English phrases and I did that because there wasn't enough space on the screen for me to add the full links or the URLs to the poster and the YouTube trailer. <br>
          <br>
          So, the first thing that happens when we learn this line of code is that the init function gets called. And the init function, you will recall, is the function we defined inside class Movie. Self, in that case, is itself or the instance being created, which is toy_story. The next argument is movie_title whose value is Toy Story. Movie_storyline gets the value Toys come to life. The variable poster_image gets the right value. And finally, the trailer_youtube variable gets the correct link. Okay, so far so good. <br>
          <br>
          Now, once init gets called and all of these arguments receive their correct values, all of the variables that are associated with the instance toy_story, they get initialized appropriately and these variables, you may notice, are title, storyline, poster_image_url and trailer_youtube_url. At this point, if I try to print out toy_story.storyline, it prints out the correct value. All right, now that we know exactly what happens when we create this instance toy story. Let's go back to our design and find out what we have to do next.<br>
          <br>
          So here we are. Back to our overarching design. And you'll notice that, thus far we've created just the one instance of our class movie. And that instance is, Toy Story. The next thing for us to do, is create another instance of class movie. And this time we're going to create,Avatar. So, to do that, I am back here at my code. Here's the code for the class movie. And, here is my entertainment_center.py filewhich, is where I'm creating my first instance, Toy Story.<br>
          <br>
          Now, you may have noticed that I've reduced the font size of my code, this is so I can squeeze all of the code, in one video frame so you can see it properly. Next, I will create the instance called avatar, by calling media.Movie. The first piece of information I have to supply, is the name of the movie, which is Avatar. Next is its storyline, which is, a marine on an alien planet. That is followed by, Avatar's movie poster, which I will paste here. And the final piece of information is, Avatar's YouTube trailer, which I will also copy in. All right. So, here is our new instance, Avatar. Let's print out it's storyline next. So I will say, print avatar.storyline.  There it is. I'm also going to comment out my previous print statement, which was printing out twice toy story, story line. So, there it is, let me go ahead and save this file. <br>
          <br>
          Now before I go ahead and run this program, let me ask you a question. What do you think, will be the output of this line of code right here? Now I know that the font of this code is really difficult to read. So what I'm going to do, is make it a little bit bigger. So here it is, the code in a bigger font size. Here is where we are creating the instance avatar, and here we're trying to print it story line. So, what do you think will be the output of the following code? Here are some answer choices.<br>
          <br>
          Alright. Let me go ahead and save this code, and then run it.  Alright. There it is. The program is printing out the correct storyline, which is for the movie Avatar. Now next, what I want to do, is figure out exactly what's happening behind the scenes when I create the instance Avatar.<br>
          <br>
          Okay, so here is the code for our class Movie one more time, and now, I am really curious in figuring out what happens behind the scenes when I create the instance called avatar by providing these four pieces of information. These, by the way, are the movie's name, its story line, the link to the movie's poster image, and the link to its YouTube URL. By the way, the last two of these two things are clearly not links or URLs. They sound more like English phrases, and I did that because there wasn't enough room on the screen for me to add the full URLs or links. 
          <br>
          <br>
          So, as soon as we run this line of code, the init function gets called. Self, in that case, is itself or the instance being created. Which is avatar. The variable movie_title gets the correct value, which is Avatar. The movie_storyline variable gets the correct value. The poster_image gets the correct value also. And finally, the trailer_youtube gets the correct trailer YouTube link. Okay, so far so good. Now, once init gets called and all of these four arguments receive their appropriate values, all of the variables that are associated with the instance avatar, they get initialized appropriately. So, at this point, if I say avatar.storyline, the program will print out the correct value. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Okay, so now, I'm going to take a small step back and tie together a few pieces of information that we've been seeing. Here is our class Movie. And after defining the class Movie, I created two of its instances, toy_story and avatar. I could have created more instances, but for now, I've just created these two. Now, when I created these two instances, what I was really doing behind the scenes, is I was setting aside space for each instance. And within that space, each instance had their own copy of variables. These variables include title, storyline, poster_image_url and trailer_youtube_url. Here are toy_story's variables, and here are avatar's variables. Now, because these variables are unique to each instance of class movie, these variables are called instance variables. And that phrase, instance variables, is another new word that I will add to our list of words.
          <br>
          <br>
          So thus far what we have done, is we have defined the class Movie and then we went ahead and defined a couple of instances of that class, namely Toy Story and Avatar. Next, what I want to do is I want to run a quick little part experiment which is, what do you think will happen if I remove the keyword self. From in front of one of the instance variables. So let me just go ahead and do that right now.  There. Now I want to think about this question. Here is the code for the class Movie one more time, and this is the self I'm wanting to remove from in front of storyline. And I want you to think about this question especially in the context of running this code, which is print(avatar.storyline). Once you have a hypothesis, I want you to enter it in this box. After you've submitted this response, I want you to make this change on your own computer and see if your hypothesis matches your result.
          <br>
          <br>
          So when we remove the keyword, self, from in front of storyline. Let me go ahead and do that one more time. What we are really doing is changing storyline from being an instance variable, accessible with instances like Toy Story and Avatar, to being a simple local variable inside the function in it. Now, I will still be able to access this variable, storyline, from anywhere inside this function in it. But not with an instance like Avatar. And since we are attempting to do that in this print statement, my hypothesis is that Python will throw an error and say that this movie object Avatar has no story line. So to check that hypothesis, I will Save my media file, and then go back to my entertainment center file and run that file. There is the error. Python says that Movie instance, in this case, Avatar, has no attribute called storyline. So, to correct this, what I will do, is go back to the code and add the self keyword in front of storyline, there.
          <br>
          <br>
          So, here is my code for the class movie, and behind it, is hidden the other programming file, where we have defined multiple instances of the class movie, namely Toy Story and Avatar. So, what I will do, is go back to my code for the class movie, and define a new function or method there called, show_trailer. Now, each instance method, whether it be init or show_trailer takes the first argument as, self. So I will add that. All, show_trailer has to do, is open the web browser, with the correct URL. And the link or the URL, is stored in the instance variable. Trailer Youtube URL. The way to access this instance variable, is through the self keyword. One last thing I need to make this code work, is to import web browser.  There, let me go ahead and save this file. Now that we have defined the method, show_trailer. The next thing for us to do, is to call this method, using our other programming file. So I will go there, and here, I already have the instance or object called, Avatar.  So I will use it, Avatar, to call the show_trailer method. I'm going to go ahead and save this file. And then I will run it. Wow, that was outstanding.<br>
          <br>
          So now that we've played Avatar's movie trailer, here's your challenge. I want you to comment out this line, the line that shows the trailer for Avatar. Then, I want you to create a new object, but this time of your favorite movie, and I want you to play its trailer instead. Here are the instructions one more time. Much like Toy Story and Avatar, we want you to create a new instance or object of the class Movie. Once you've done that, we want you to play a trailer of that movie using the new instance or object. And finally, we want you to share a screenshot of your program's output on the discussion forum. Now, in case you have a way to video record your computer screen, perhaps using a smartphone, you can also share a Youtube video of your output with us. Make sure to check this box after submitting your response on the forum.
          <br>
          <br>
          Thank you for sharing your responses on the forum. Now, in writing all of this code, we've seen a lot of new words. Let's review all of them. So here I have both of my programming files on the screen at the same time. Here's my first programming file where I'm making the class movie. And the second one, when I'm defining instances of that class, instances like Toy Story and Avatar. Now, you may have to go into Full Screen mode to be able to read all of the details on the screen. Okay, let's start reviewing all of the new words. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Summary:
          So, we started out by defining a class. The class Keyword allows us to make classes. You can think of a class as a blueprint. And a class can have both data and methods. Now, we can create multiple instances of a class. In this case, we created instances like Toy Story and Avatar. We could have created many more. Now, when we create an instance of a class, instance like Toy Story, the classes constructor gets called. This is essentially the init method inside the class. It is here that we initialize all of the data associated with the instance. The constructor uses the keyword, self. Now, you can think of self as itself or the instance in question. So, when the instance Toy Story is getting created, self is Toy Story. All the variables associated with a specific instance are called instance variables. Now, these are unique to an object and can be accessed using the self keyword inside the class and the instance name outside the class. And, finally, all of the functions inside the class that are associated with an instance and have the first argument as self are called instance methods. So there you have it. All of the new words that we have learned thus far, right there on one screen.
          <br>
          <br>
          So now that we've learned, a bunch of new words related with classes and objects, we will move on to creating a movie website. And here is the final output that we are after. All of our favorite movies, on a web page. And as you have seen previously, if you click on anyone of these movies, we see its trailer. Let's build this. So here I am, back with my code. Now thus far, we've made only two movie objects. Toy Story and Avatar. I'm going to make a few more. In fact, four more movie objects. But before I do that, I want to make this window, a little bit bigger, so we can see all of this code really easily. Okay. So here are the two instances we have created thus far. Toy Story and Avatar. Now before I proceed, I will go ahead and comment out the previous output statements that I created. This print statement and the show trailer method. So let me just add a comment there,  and there. Done. Now, I'm going to add a new movie object, for a movie called, School of Rock. There it is. You will notice, that I have changed the name of the movie, its story-line, its poster image, and its future trailer values appropriately. Next, I will add another movie object. This time, for an animated movie called Ratatouille. Next, I will add a movie object called, Midnight in Paris. Now this, happens to be one of my favorite movies. And the final movie object I will add, is for a movie called, the Hunger Games. Okay, so thus far, we have created six movie objects. So far, so good. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Now, to turn this into a movie website. You will need a piece of code that weed out. Now we call this code, fresh_tomatoes.py. By the way, this file is available for you to download in the instructor notes. Now before we use it, let's see what this file actually does. This file, fresh_tomatoes.py, has a function inside it called, open_movies_page. Let's look at this function a bit more closely. Now, what this function does, is that it takes in, a list of movies as input, and as output it creates and opens an HTML page or a website, that shows the movies you gave it in the first place. So what I'm going to do next, is use this file, fresh_tomatoes.py, and it's function, open_movies_page, inside our code.
          <br>
          <br>
          So let me start this video by saying that in case this code did not work for you, ask us questions on the discussion forum. We are here to help. Now, you may be curious about this file called fresh_tomatoes, so let's talk about it next. Now, I want you to recall that this file, fresh_tomatoes.py, had a function inside it called, open_movies_page. Now this function, receives a list of movies, and then, creates and opens an HTML file or a webpage that showcases those movies. By the way, it stores this HTML file, in the exact same folder, as all of your other movie program files. So let me go to that folder now. And here is my movies folder, with all of my Python movie files right here. Notice that this is the HTML file that we just created by running our program. This is the file that actually showed us all of our movies and played the trailer. And here is the fresh_tomatoes Python file that you downloaded from our website. Let me open it. Alright. Here is the code for our Python file, fresh_tomatoes.py. Now, while I won't go through this entire code in detail, I encourage you to read through this program. I want you to understand how it takes in a list of movies and creates a website to show those movies. Now, we've added comments to this file that will make this code readable. Alright the next thing we want to do is we want you to share the movie website that you've created thus far. 
          <br>
          <br>
          So here's your task, we want you to create your very own movie website with your favorite movies. Once you've done that we want you to share any one of the following two things with us on the forum. You can take a screenshot or an image of your movie website and share that with us on the forum, or if you have access to a smartphone we want you to record and share a YouTube video of you showing your movie website to a friend. Once you've submitted your responses on the forum, make sure to check this box.

          Class Variables:
          So we've come a long way in this course, from drawing shapes, to designing a movie website. And what we're going to do here in this lesson is talk about some advanced ideas in object-oriented programming. The first of which is called class variables. Let's talk about it next.
          <br>
          <br>
          So let's begin by recalling this thing called the instance variables. In the case of Class Movie, there were several of them, title, storyline, poster image URL, and trailer YouTube URL. Now, further recall that these variables are associated with every instance that we create. For example, both Toy Story and Avatar have their own copies of these variables. So I could print out Toy Story's storyline and I could also print out Avatar's storyline. Sometimes however, we need variables that we want all of our instances to share. So consider the variable valid ratings for a movie. This is an array or a list, of all possible ratings a movie could have. Now, it would not quite make sense to say, hey, here are Toy Story's valid ratings, and here are Avatar's valid ratings. They would essentially be the same for all instances. Thus, this variable is really associated with a Class Movie. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Instructor Notes
          Around 0:40 or so, Kunal said with regard to the valid_ratings variable:
          "...This is an array or a list..."
          To avoid confusion down the road: Arrays and lists are actually not the same thing in Python. 99.9% of the time, you'll want to use lists. They're flexible, and good for pretty much every purpose.
          However, there is also an array.array class in Python, which is essentially a thin wrapper on top of C arrays.
          They're not something you'll probably need to use, but read more here if interested: http://www.wired.com/2011/08/python-notes-lists-vs-arrays/
          <br>
          <br>
          And is therefore called a Class Variable. Let's see it in action. So here is the code for our Class Movie. And behind this Python file is the other Python file we created, where we made a bunch of movie instances. So I'm going to begin by making changes to my Class Movie. Now here I will define a variable called valid ratings. Now notice that this variable valid ratings is defined at the level of the class and is outside the init function. In order to start using this variable, we will begin by saving this file first. So next I'm going to go to my other Python file. By the way, this is the file where we are defining a bunch of movie instances. And here, I will scroll down all the way to the bottom. And comment out any sort of print or output statements. Now, I'm doing this so I can focus primarily on valid ratings. Now, here, I will try to print out the value of the variable valid ratings by saying, print, and the name of my class, which is media.Movie, followed by the name of the variable, which is valid. Ratings. There. Let me save and run this program. And boom. There it is. A list of all of my valid ratings. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Notice how we use the class name movie to access this variable. This means that all instances of this class movie. Toy Story, Avatar and others, they can share this list, they can share this list to see if their individual rating is a valid one or not. Okay, so the one last thing I want to do is go back to my class movie. Now notice that the value of this variable valid_strings is probably a constant, by that I mean, that the value of this variable is probably not going change every now and then. When we define a constant like this, the Google Style Guide for Python recommends that we use all caps or an upper case to define a variable like that. I'm going to go ahead and save this file and then go back to my other Python file and change the variable name there as well.  Let me save and run this program to see if it still works. And there it is, I get the correct output one more time.
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          Pre-existing Class Variables:
          So now that we know a little bit about class variables, let's move on to another idea in object oriented programming, which is that in Python, all classes come with some pre-existing class variables. One of them is called doc. Now this variable has got underscores on both sides of its name. Let's see this variable in action. So here I am at the Python Shell window, with the Python prompt. And I can type a program in here like 2+2 and it gives me the correct answer. Now I want us to recall this class called turtle that we had used some time back while drawing shapes. So I can just import that class turtle here. There, then let me see what happens when I use the class name. turtle.Turtle. Remember this was the name of the module or the file and this was the class name. So if I use the class name with the prepackaged variable called doc. Let me see what it prints out. I get some kind of documentation on the class turtle. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Now I wonder if I can use this variable doc with my class movie. So, I'm back to the code for the class movie and behind this file is my other Python file where, I'm defining a whole bunch of instances of class Movie. Let me go back to the code for class Movie here for a second. Now, here, I'm going to add some documentation. At the beginning of the class Movie. You may have noticed that I use triple codes, to define my documentation. Now what I can do with triple codes, is I can create documentation in multiple lines. For now I just have the one line. So I'm going to save this file, and then go to my other Python file. And here, I'm going to scroll all the way to the bottom, and comment out any sort of print statements. There. Now, I will try to print out my class Movie, which is accessed by saying, media.Movie. I will try to print out its documentation.  There. Let me save and run this file. And there it is. 
          <br>
          <br>
          The documentation for my class Movie. Notice how I accessed it though. I accessed it using my class name, which is movie and a predefined class variable, called doc. So, now that we have successfully used this variable called doc. I have a question for you. You know much like the variable doc, Python has a few more predefined variables these include the variable name and module. By the way more information about these is also available through links in the instructor notes. What I want you to do is read through the documentation in the instructor notes and then I want you to use these variables name. And module, in a new program. Once you have done that, please come back to the screen and check this box.
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          Inheritance:
          So, now that we know a little bit about class variables, both the ones that we created and the ones that come by default or predefined in Python classes, I want to take a moment to talk about the next big idea in object-oriented programming which is called inheritance. Now, let's think about the meaning of this word inheritance and how we use it in the English language. You may have heard someone say that a child can inherit some traits from their parents. Things like the last name, the eye color, some money, if the kid is lucky. So, if we were to take this meaning of inheritance, like we commonly use it in the English language, and turn it into code or model this in terms of programming, we would create a class called Parent. Which would have some attributes like last name and eye color. And then we would make a class called class Child which would inherit these two things from the class Parent. Additionally, the class Child could have another variable of its own called number of toys. Now, you may notice that if we design code like this, we are already beginning to reuse code, which is a huge advantage of object oriented programming. Okay, so the next thing we are going to do is take our design and convert it into actual code. Let's do that next.
          <br>
          <br>
          Okay, so here we have our design of the classes we are going to build up on the top right hand corner, and what I've done thus far is created a new Python file, and I called it inheritance.py. Now, based on our design, I'm going to go ahead and create a class called Parent. [SOUND] There. The next thing to do is to initialize the variables of class Parent, variables like last_name and eye_color. So, to do that, I will define this class as init method or constructor. The first argument for this function, we know, is self. And the two instance variables for class Parent, we know, are self.last_name and self.eye_color. Now the init function we know will receive a couple of values as arguments. So, let me add them in here, and we will use these two arguments to initialize our instance variables. Let me do that next. Alright. You may notice that this piece of code is pretty similar to the code for class Movie that we have written previously. By the way, one new thing I will do here, is add a quick print statement inside the init method. It will print out, Parent Constructor Called. So, this print statement will explicitly tell us, each time the init method or the constructor of class Parent is called. Alright, to make sure that this code that we have written thus far actually works, let's go ahead and use this class. I will define an instance of class Parent and call it billy_cyrus, and will provide the two arguments that are necessary. The first of which is last_name and that happens to be Cyrus, and the next one is eye_color which is, let's say, blue. Now, a quick word of caution. Ordinarily, I would have kept these two things, the definition of the class Parent and creating its instances. I would have kept them in separate Python files. But I have kept them both here in the same file for ease of demonstration. Okay, so to demonstrate that the instance actually works, I'll print out its last name. Let me save and then run this file. And there's my output. It says the parent constructor was called. Which seems appropriate, because we created an instance called billy_cyrus. And as soon as we did that, the class Parent's _initl_ method got called, which had a print statement inside it. And then, we printed out Billy Cyrus's last name, which it printed out correctly. Okay, so far so good. Now, you'll notice that there really isn't anything new that we've done here thus far. The new thing we're going to try is called inheritance, which will happen when we create the class called Child. Let's do that next.
          <br>
          <br>
          Okay, so here is the code for class Parent and now I will start to define class Child. Now, I know class Child inherits from class Parent and the way to indicate that in Python is to say this. The syntax here means that class Child will now inherit or reuse everything that is publicly available in class Parent. Now, things will get really interesting when we begin to define the init method, or the constructor for this class. So, we know that class Child has three variables. Last name and eye color that are inherited from class Parent. And this other variable called number_of_toys. So, in addition to the key word self, I will receive those values as arguments right here in the init function; there they are. Now, to initialize the variables I'm inheriting from class Parent, variables like last_name and eye_color, I will actually reuse class Parent's init method. This is how we do it. The last instance variable, number_of_toys, will be initialized next. Okay, finally, I will add a print statement to the very beginning of the init method. All right, now that we have defined our class Child, the next thing to do is to create an instance of this class Child. I will call it, appropriately enough, miley_cyrus. And here, I will provide it the three necessary arguments. And then, I will print out two things. Her last name, and the number of toys. Also, so I can focus on these print statements in my output, I will comment out the previous instance for now. There. Let me save this file. Now, before I run this program, I want you to think about what the output of this program will be. So, here is the code one more time. Here is class Parent, and here is class Child, and here, we are creating an instance of class Child, and we named it miley_cyrus. So, what do you think will be printed when I run this piece of code? Enter your responses in this box.
          <br>
          <br>
          So before I run this program, let me share with you my hypothesis of what will happen when I run this piece of code. Now one of the first things we are doing here in this program, is that we're creating an instance of class child we called it miley_cyrus. As soon as that line of code runs, the init method inside class child will get called. The first line within the init method, is this print statement. So my hypothesis is, that this print statement will be printed out first in our output. After that the constructor for the class parent is going to get called. So the control will move from here up to here. When the init method for class parent is called, this statement is going to get executed. So my hypothesis is that this print statement parent constructor called will be the second thing that gets printed. Then the instance variable's last name and eye color will be appropriately initialized. Once the init method for class parent has successfully run, the control will come back here. At that point, the instance variable number_of_toys will successfully get initialized. So at that point, the init method for class child is done, which means that the instance miley_cyrus has been created successfully. Then, the following two print statements which are trying to print the last name and number of toys for miley_cyrus will get executed in that order. Alright, this time let me actually run this piece of code. And there's my output. And it seems pretty close to what I thought it would be. Now, I want you to pause the video here for a second, and I want you to see if the output here matches your hypothesis.
          <br>
          <br>
          Ok, so we've just seen how inheritance can help us reuse code. In our example, we saw that class Child can reuse some of the code written in class Parent. Now I want to use the same technique of inheritance, to see if I can improve my design for class Movie that I wrote previously. Let's do that next. So in a previous lesson we created a class called movie. Now this class had the following attributes, the movie's title, its storyline, a link to the movie's poster image, and a link to its YouTube trailer. Now in addition to these things, the class movie also had a function called show_trailer. After we had defined this class movie we created several instances of this class. Instances like Toy Story and Avatar. Now further imagine that we wanted to create another class called TvShow. I would think that this class would have details like the title of the show, its season and episode number. And also, the TV station that this show is aired on. Additionally, this class could also have a function called, get_local_listings. Once we've created a class called TvShow, we can create multiple instances of this class, instances like, season one, episode one of Breaking Bad, and the final episode of Seinfeld. Alright, so if we continue our thought experiment here, we can further imagine that there can be several items that both of these classes can share amongst each other. Things like title for sure, also things like duration of the movie and duration of the TV show in minutes. So the best way to structure this code would be to create another class called Video, which would have two attributes. The video's title, and the video's duration. And the class Movie, could inherit from this class Video. To do this, we would have to add the class name Video, inside these parentheses. Now, this would mean that class Movie, would inherit title and duration, from class Video. Additionally, the class TvShow could also inherit from class Video. To do this we would also have to add the class name Video inside these parentheses. Now this would mean that class TvShow would inherit title and duration from class video. Now you can clearly see how we can write a piece of code. In this case, class Video, and continue to reuse it in multiple different places. Another big benefit of writing code this way, in addition to just reusing code, is that it allows us to follow an intuitive model of how things exist in our brain. So intuitively speaking, we know what videos are, we also know what TV shows and movies are. So writing code in this way allows programmers to map how things exist in our brain onto code.
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          Reusing Instance Variables:
          Okay, so thus far, we've seen how inheritance can help us with reusing instance variables. Now I want to show you an example of how inheritance can help with reusing methods. So here we are back at the code, where we have a class called Parent and a class called Child. And if you recall, class Child inherits from class Parent. Now, I'll begin by defining a simple instance method inside class Parent. And I will call it show_info. The first argument of this method is self, and all this method does is it prints out the last name and eye color of the parent. All right, there are the two print statements. Now to test to see if this method actually works, I'm going to call this method show_info using the parent's instance billy_cyrus. So let me do that next. So there is that method. Now all I've done thus far is created a new method called show_info inside class Parent. And then used an instance of class Parent, instance called billy_cyrus to call that method. Now to be able to focus on this statement's output, I am going to comment out the other instance statement for now. There. Let me go ahead and save and run this program. Alright. So the program prints out the correct values of billy_cyrus' last name and eye color. So far so good.
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          Method Overriding:
          Alright so I'm going to come back to the code, and this time I'm going to do something new. Now because this class Child inherits from class Parent this method show_info is also inherited. Now this means that instances of class Child instances like miley_cyrus, they can also call the show_info method, even though this method is not explicitly defined inside class Child. Let me do that next. So the first thing I will do is uncomment this line of code where I'm creating the instance called miley_cyrus, and then use that instance, to call the method show_info. There. Now because I want to focus on the output of this show_info method, I'm going to comment out the previous show_info method for now. There. Now before I run this program, I want to highlight one more time that I'm using the instance miley_cyrus to call the method show_info. Now this method does not explicitly exist inside class Child. But because class Child inherits from class Parent this method show_info is actually available to the instances of class Child. So let me go ahead and save and run this program. And there is my output. The program did not throw any errors, and the last name and eye color of the instance miley_cyrus did get printed out. Okay. So the next thing I am going to do is create a method called show_info inside class Child, and see what that does. So I'm going to create a new method called show_info inside class Child. Now this method show_info is going to print out the three things associated with a child. It's last name, eye color, and number of toys. Here we are printing the last name of the child. Now we are printing the child's eye color, and finally, we are printing the number of toys. In order to print this number correctly, we had to wrap it around the string function. Now, if I save and run this program, my hypothesis is that when I call the show_info method using miley_cyrus, which by the way is an instance of class Child. This show_info method is going to get called and not the show_info method in the class Parent. So let me save and run this program. And there's the output. We're printing out the last name, eye color and number of toys of the instance of class Child. So really what we have done here is defined the method by the same name show_info inside class Child, and also inside class Parent. This ability of a sub-class, in this case the class Child, to override a method that it inherited from its parent class is called Method Overriding in programming.<br>

          Fish, Salmon, Classes, and Objects<br>
          Hello again! I hope you're enjoying Course 3 and I'm sorry to interrupt, but I feel compelled to share a great resource with you.<br>
          When I was learning Object Oriented Programming I remember being fascinated by the idea (especially the idea of inheritance) but struggling with all the vocabulary. But learning the vocabulary becomes really important when you actually want to use OOP in the code you write.<br>

The resource I want to share comes from a free online book called "Learn Python the Hard Way," which I definitely recommend you check out if you want to learn more about Python. The section I want you to read does a fantastic job explaining the difference between a Class and an Object and it uses a simple question to motivate the whole thing:<br>
